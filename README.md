# Book Library
Book library app created with HTML, CSS & Javascript for The Odin Project.

## Demo
Here is a working live demo: https://kapaha.github.io/book-library/

## General info
This project was created as a part of the [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library) course with [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). The aim of this project was to solidate the knowledge I have learnt about Objects and Object Constructors. Later on, as part of a lesson on [Classes](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/classes), I refactored the code to use class instead of plain constructors.

* Remove unwanted books - click the bin icon to remove book

## Status
The project is finished, however I may continue to improve on it as my knowledge of web development improves.
